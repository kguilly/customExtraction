Running on HP Victus:

    Python:
        - Using pygrib to iterate over the layers of the file and extract the values
            - One file:
                -time: 28.51 seconds
                - mem: max = 216.4 MiB or 226.4924 MB


When I come back:
    - profile fudong's extraction code
        - for a single file, single day, and single month
        - for the state of louisiana

    - Work on fudong's tutorial
        - use herbie to download the data
        - use pygrib to extract the data

    - Build Figures for Fudong
